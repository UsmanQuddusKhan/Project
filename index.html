<h1>Are You Chatting With a Human or a Computer?</h1>
<p>The Turing test, a means of determining whether a computer possesses intelligence, requires it to trick a human into thinking it's chatting with another person</p>

        <q>Alan Turing proposed that if a machine could reliably fool a human conversational partner into thinking that it was human, that machine would have demonstrated real artificial intelligence. The original formulation of the test called for a human and a computer to both have a conversation with a judge through a text only medium. If the judge could not reliably distinguish between the machine and the human, the machine would have met Turing's standards for machine intelligence. <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>

        <q><strong>Siri<strong> is a program that comes with all iPhone 4s's. In 2010, Apple purchased Siri, which began as a project funded by DARPA, the same government agency that created the Internet. <strong>in modern browsers</strong> shouldn't <strong>copy the limits</strong> of 'classic' slide decks?</q>

        <q><strong>Cleverbot<strong> is a chat program which passes the Turing Test, the criteria for passing is vague, so the exact standards for passing are unclear, but it scored an impressive rankingof 59.3% human at the 2011 Techniche Festival in India (the human controls were scored as 63.3% human). Unlike many other programs in the field, Cleverbot uses its vast store of past conversations (over 65 million!) from its function as an internet application and lab test subject to string together answers that it has been fed by humans before.<q></div>
