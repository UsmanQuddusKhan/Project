        <q>Alan Turing proposed that if a machine could reliably fool a human conversational partner into thinking that it was human, that machine would have demonstrated real artificial intelligence. The original formulation of the test called for a human and a computer to both have a conversation with a judge through a text only medium. If the judge could not reliably distinguish between the machine and the human, the machine would have met Turing's standards for machine intelligence. <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>

        <q><strong>Siri<strong> is a program that comes with all iPhone 4s's. In 2010, Apple purchased Siri, which began as a project funded by DARPA, the same government agency that created the Internet. <strong>in modern browsers</strong> shouldn't <strong>copy the limits</strong> of 'classic' slide decks?</q>
